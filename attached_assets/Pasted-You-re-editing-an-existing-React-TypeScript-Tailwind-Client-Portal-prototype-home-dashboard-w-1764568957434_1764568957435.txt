You’re editing an existing React + TypeScript + Tailwind “Client Portal” prototype (home dashboard with hero metrics and campaign flip cards).
Please update the navigation to match this new IA, without breaking the existing hero metrics / cards.

Tech assumptions: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, React Router.

1. Global layout
	•	Keep the existing top bar (search, notifications, user avatar).
	•	Keep the home content (hero metrics + flip cards) for the / route.

2. Update left sidebar nav to:
	•	Home
	•	Targets
	•	“All Targets” (targets list)
	•	“Target Dashboard” (single-target view)
	•	Campaigns
	•	“Campaigns Home”
	•	“Always On Campaigns”
	•	“Tactical Campaigns”
	•	Creative
	•	“Content Library”
	•	“Messaging Strategy”
	•	“Add Content”

Use a simple vertical sidebar with section labels and nested items (indent child items under their parent). Highlight:
	•	Active top-level item (solid or bold)
	•	Active child item (subtle accent)

3. Icons

Use lucide-react icons or similar:
	•	Home: Home
	•	Targets: Target
	•	Campaigns: Flag or Layers
	•	Creative: Palette
	•	Child links can be icon-less or use smaller bullets.

4. Routing
	•	Set up React Router routes for:
	•	/ → Home (existing dashboard)
	•	/targets → All Targets (simple table or list placeholder)
	•	/targets/:id → Target Dashboard (stub layout with placeholder sections: “Target Metadata”, “Target Hero Metrics”, “Target Activity Feed”, “Tactical Performance”, “Always On Contributions”)
	•	/campaigns → Campaigns Home (placeholder text)
	•	/campaigns/always-on → Always On Campaigns (placeholder table/list)
	•	/campaigns/tactical → Tactical Campaigns (list of tacticals; each row links out to the corresponding /targets/:id dashboard rather than a separate tactical page)
	•	/creative/library → Content Library (grid/list placeholder)
	•	/creative/messaging → Messaging Strategy (placeholder)
	•	/creative/add → Add Content (simple form stub)

The key behaviour: Tactical campaign rows link to Target Dashboards, not to standalone tactical pages.

5. Visual style
	•	Keep the existing Yappy look (light background, Yappy orange accent).
	•	Sidebar background slightly darker than page background; active item uses Yappy orange text or left border.
	•	Use Tailwind for spacing/typography; keep it clean and minimal (no heavy cards/shadows for nav).

6. Small UX niceties
	•	Show the current section title at the top of the main content area (e.g. “Targets”, “Campaigns”, “Creative”).
	•	When navigating, the sidebar should correctly reflect the active route (parent + child).

Please update the existing code accordingly, refactoring where needed but preserving the home dashboard content and styling.
