Please update the EXISTING Yappy Home screen prototype with the following visual and UX changes. 
Do NOT redesign the hero cards or flip cards from scratch; just refine labels, nav styling, and behaviour as described.

------------------------------------------------------------
1) EXPORT BUTTON LABEL
------------------------------------------------------------
• Change the button label near the hero metrics from:
      "Export Hero Metrics"
  to:
      "Export Chart"

• Keep the same functionality (PNG/PDF/CSV export of the hero metrics area).
• If the button tooltip or aria-label references "hero metrics", update it to something neutral like
  "Export performance overview chart".

------------------------------------------------------------
2) LEFT SIDEBAR MENU – VISUAL RESTYLE
------------------------------------------------------------
The left nav currently looks visually disconnected from the main panels. 
Please restyle it so it better matches the clean card aesthetic used in the main content.

Guidance:
• Overall:
   - Background: solid white or very light neutral (NOT a strong gradient).
   - Remove heavy gradient fills and overly warm tints; keep it subtle and modern.
   - Use the same border radius language as the cards (e.g. rounded corners on the active item pill).

• Items:
   - Keep the same structure and labels (Home, Campaigns, Reporting, Creative with sub-items).
   - Use simple, line-style icons to the left of each top-level label (consistent size and colour).
   - Active item:
       - Light background “pill” (e.g. #FFF7F0 or similar light orange tint).
       - A slim left border OR small indicator in Yappy orange (#F77C22).
       - Text in medium/bold weight.
   - Hover state:
       - Very light grey background (#F5F5F5), no heavy borders.

• Typography:
   - Use the same font and base size as the main panels.
   - Top-level items slightly larger or bolder than sub-items.
   - Sub-items indented and a bit lighter in weight.

The goal is a calm, minimal sidebar that visually harmonises with the hero metric cards and campaign cards.

------------------------------------------------------------
3) HERO METRICS CONTEXT COPY (TOTALS VS TRENDS)
------------------------------------------------------------
Add a short line of explanatory text near the hero metrics row to clarify the timeframe.

• Place this text just above or below the row title (currently "Performance Overview") or aligned to the right under the title.

Suggested copy:
   "Totals shown are all-time; trend indicators show month-on-month change."

• Use smaller, lighter text than the main heading so it’s informative but not visually loud.

------------------------------------------------------------
4) FLIP CARD CTA – VIEW CAMPAIGN DASHBOARD
------------------------------------------------------------
I want each campaign flip card to:
   a) Still clearly indicate it can flip.
   b) Also provide a CTA to navigate to a dedicated campaign dashboard under the Campaigns menu.

Please implement the following behaviour:

FRONT OF CARD:
• Keep the existing visual design and flip indicator (e.g. the arrow icon or hover effect that suggests flipping).
• The primary interaction with the main card surface should continue to FLIP the card.

BACK OF CARD:
• Keep the “Top 3 Targets” / “Top 3 Content” information as implemented.
• Add a clear CTA element, such as a button or text link, e.g.:
      [ View Campaign Details ]
• Clicking this CTA should navigate to the campaign dashboard view associated with that card.
   - This view should live under the existing Campaigns section (e.g. route like `/campaigns/:id`).
   - For now, it can be a simple placeholder page with the campaign name and “Campaign Dashboard – Coming Soon”.

Interaction rules:
• Clicking anywhere on the card body (except the CTA button) toggles flip state (front ↔ back).
• Clicking the "View Campaign Details" CTA does NOT flip; it navigates to the campaign dashboard view.

Visual style:
• The CTA should be obvious but not visually overpowering.
• Use a small primary button or strong link in Yappy orange, aligned to the bottom-right of the back of the card.

------------------------------------------------------------
5) ROUTING / NAV CONSISTENCY
------------------------------------------------------------
• Ensure that navigating to a campaign dashboard from the flip card:
   - Highlights the appropriate item under Campaigns in the left nav.
   - Updates the main content area while keeping the top nav and sidebar intact.

------------------------------------------------------------
6) DELIVERABLE
------------------------------------------------------------
Please share:
• Updated JSX/TSX for:
   - The hero metrics section (with the new context text and "Export Chart" label).
   - The SidebarNav component with the new visual styling.
   - The campaign flip card component with the new "View Campaign Details" CTA.
• Any new routing code for campaign dashboard views.
• CSS/Tailwind/styled-component changes for:
   - Sidebar restyle
   - Hero metrics context text
   - CTA on the back of the flip cards.
